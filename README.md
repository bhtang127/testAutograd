## Testing Autograding

There are two questions in this test assignment, but answers are already in the files therefore there's nothing you need to do.

### Question 1:
There is a 2 variables function called `func` in [gradient.py](https://github.com/bhtang127/testAutograd/blob/main/gradient.py), please read through and understand it.
Then implement a function called `grad` to calculate its gradient.

### Question 2:
There is a simulated data called `data` in [lm_basic.R](https://github.com/bhtang127/testAutograd/blob/main/lm_basic.R).
Please fit a linear model `y = a + b * X1 + c * X2` using that data. Then store the intercept in variable `intercept`, coefficient of X1 in variable `coeff1` and coefficient of X2 in variable `coeff2`
